I am writing as a constituent to express my OUTRAGE over Senate Bill 1287 (SB 1287) and its potential implications for free speech and academic freedom in California. This bill poses a significant threat to the open exchange of ideas and critical discourse on college campuses.

SB 1287 could severely restrict students' ability to openly discuss crucial issues, including social justice and human rights, which are fundamental to higher education. I urge you to oppose this bill and make a statement in support of free speech and academic freedom in California.

With concern,
`
