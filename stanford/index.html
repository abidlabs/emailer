const body = `Dear President Saller,

I am writing as a very concerned member of the Stanford community to express my support for the students at the encampment protest. I urge the administration to engage with the students on their divestment demands and to refrain from using police force, physical violence, or disciplinary punishment against the students.

I am horrified by the recent reports of police violence against students on some campuses and I urge the administration to take immediate action to ensure the safety and well-being of all students on campus. It would be a tragedy if the situation were to escalate further and result in harm to students.

I urge the administration to listen to the students' concerns and to work with them to find a peaceful resolution to the situation. The students have a right to express their views and to protest peacefully, and it is the administration's responsibility to protect that right.

The situation in Gaza is a humanitarian crisis and it is important for the Stanford community to stand in solidarity with the students who are advocating for Palestinian rights. 

Thank you,
`
