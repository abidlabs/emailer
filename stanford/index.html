I am HORRIFIED by the recent reports of police violence against students on some campuses. I implore the Stanford administration to take immediate action to ensure the safety and well-being of those students who have set up an encampment in support of Palestinians.

I urge the administration to listen to the students' concerns. The students have a right to express their views and to protest peacefully, and it is the administration's responsibility to protect that right.

The situation in Gaza is a humanitarian crisis. It horrifies anyone with a conscience, and Stanford's silence is shocking. At the very least, Stanford should be a place where students can express their views without fear of violence or retribution by the administration.

With heartfelt concern,
`
